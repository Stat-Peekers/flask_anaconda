# Flask + Anaconda website
This is a project to create an interactive Data Science website using flask and anaconda.

**Folder structure:**
> Main folder
> - *src* (contains all source files i.e. this repository)
> - *data* (contains all data files (json) used to build Viz and ML models
> - *docs* (contains all relevant documentation)
 
PS: data and docs folders are on your local system and can be modified as per the user's requirement.
I will get rid of these once I set-up APIs for data
